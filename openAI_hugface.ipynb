We began with an early access tour of the memorial, which we booked directly through the museum’s website.  This tour of the memorial begins one hour before the museum opens and is limited in space.  I felt the tour was a gentle way to ease into such a difficult event.  Our tour guide, Charles, was knowledgeable and was able to answer everyone’s questions.  His voice was soft, calm, and somber, which helped provide an appropriate tone for the tour and a calming presence.\\n\\nThe tour ticket included access to the museum, so we visited the museum after the tour was finished.  We spent 3 hours in the museum and didn’t finish.  We could have stayed another 3 hours, but we were emotionally spent.  The museum was rich in detail and artifacts.  As the morning wore on, the museum became congested with people, making navigating the museum, reading the plaques, and seeing the artifacts difficult.\\n\\nAlthough children were in the memorial and museum, I personally wouldn’t recommend this for children.  Some of the descriptions and artifacts are graphic and could be disturbing to children.\\n\\nBeing from Texas and this being my 1st visit to NYC, I feel the memorial and museum helped me connect more personally to one of our nation’s most tragic and defining events., Traveled as a couple Well-done memorial for events of 9/11, The memorial and museum are very nice tributes to the events of 9/11. It doesn't feel exploitative or over the top. It's somber and appropriate to memorialize what happened. We did a self-guided tour and spent about 2.5 hours in the museum, plus some additional time outside at the memorial. We bought tickets in advance online, which I would recommend if you want a tour guide (they sell out) or if you will be there on a busy day. Per the NYC guidelines, they are checking everyone's vaccine cards or negative COVID tests before you can enter. Solemn Memorial, This was my third visit but the family’s first.\\n\\nBuying tickets online was the best option since you could see the available tickets based on date and time and better plan a visit.  You could still buy tickets in person but one had to queue and then wait in another line to enter.\\n\\nWe were about 15 minutes early for our timed entrance but were allowed inside since it was cold and raining.  The weather actually worked to our favor since the lines were much shorter that day\\n\\nOnce inside we descended to the lower level and started our visit.  Of course everyone bunched up at the beginning but thinned out as we walked further into the museum.  As we walked down to the North and South Tower excavations we walked next to the Survivor Stairs which was used by many during the escape from the WTC.  \\n\\nThe excavations were very similar giving you a view of the slurry, foundation and construction that went into building and supporting the WTC. \\n\\nK-9 Courage showcased the dogs who were involved in search and recovery efforts.\\n\\nIn Memoriam was an honor roll and contained biographies and photos.\\n\\nThe historical exhibition contained many artifacts, details and insights into 9/11 not just in NY but also in Washington DC and flight 93.  This was the most crowded area in the museum but also had the most things to see.  Plan to spend most of your time here.\\n\\nOutside the reflection pools were built on the original footprints of the WTC towers.\\n\\nIt can be an emotional experience.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":26}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2.1 Using OpenAI to create the Embeddings #"],"metadata":{"id":"W4hSvP_TINEb"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Importing packages and providing openai API key\n","import openai\n","import tiktoken\n","kraj_openAI = credentials['kraj_OpenAI']\n","openai.api_key = kraj_openAI"],"metadata":{"id":"z_yY7umrIUwF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687723316271,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":171,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def get_embedding(text, model=\"text-embedding-ada-002\"):\n","   text = text.replace(\"\\n\", \" \")\n","   return openai.Embedding.create(input = [text], model=model)['data'][0]['embedding']\n","true_df['ada_embedding'] = true_df.output.apply(lambda x: get_embedding(x, model='text-embedding-ada-002'))\n","true_df['ada_embedding'].head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"XJlKiiO6KITL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687723656664,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":338332,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}},"outputId":"0426c9f6-d337-4660-d074-0bb1a6f5c29e"},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0    [0.01897539757192135, 0.007253372110426426, 0....\n","1    [-0.03039538487792015, -0.019227877259254456, ...\n","2    [-0.01814405433833599, -0.0016772090457379818,...\n","3    [-0.01892925053834915, -0.00984242931008339, -...\n","4    [-0.0012649726122617722, -0.014345696195960045...\n","Name: ada_embedding, dtype: object"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":28}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2.2 Using OpenAI tiktoken to count length of entries in description and reviews #"],"metadata":{"id":"gLce6lw6Qo-u"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["true_df['des_reviews'] = true_df['description'].astype(str) + \" ; \" +  true_df[\"REVIEWS\"].astype(str)\n","true_df.head(10)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":811},"id":"JcG82mjWMARB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687723704830,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":182,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}},"outputId":"deae73ca-006e-4e37-dc37-977a5a46e3d6"},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                             PICTURE    DESTINATION  \\\n","0  https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/medi...

Description: At New York City\\'s most visited museum and attraction, you will experience over 5,000 years of art from around the world. The Met is for anyone as a source of inspiration, insight and understanding. You can learn, escape, play, dream, discover, connect. ; Reviews: Immense Historical Collective, The Metropolitan Museum Of Art is truly an Immense collective of history from all continents. It is indeed one of the well preserved and renowned museums in the world. Upon arrival, you walk up the grand steps, take some time for a photo op, walk through security scanners and you’re in to the grand hall. Local residents may enter for free but must queue in a rather long line to take advantage of this. There are several visual and audiovisual guides so be sure to take advantage of those materials at the center console upon entry. It is rather difficult to see the museum in its entirety in one day, especially if you are taking it all in and moving at a casual pace. The museum holds incredibly well curated artifacts and truly is a must-see when in New York., Traveled solo If only we had more time!, What an amazing museum! I absolutely loved the time we spent in the Met and wish we could have had longer. \\nWe had prepaid tickets for 10am and there was a slight queue when we arrived about 9.40/9.45am. Unlike MoMA and the American Museum of Natural History, there was a separate line for those who had prepaid tickets (and members) vs. those who hadn’t, so that may have helped. It was definitely a much less chaotic experience to enter the Met than at the other 2 museums, in any case!\\nMake sure you pick up a museum map when you enter, as the place is massive and a bit of a labyrinth! The guards and volunteers are always happy to point you in the right direction if you get too discombobulated, though.\\nWe headed straight to the section with 19th and early 20th century European paintings, knowing that some of these (e.g., the van Goghs and Monets) would be bustling with people later on, and we were able to have some time enjoying these paintings almost completely by ourselves for some time. There were a number of paintings by my favourite artist, Cezanne, so I was very happy indeed 😊 \\n(A previous reviewer complained that Christina’s World and Picasso weren’t on display, but Christina’s World is in MoMA, and both the Met and MoMA had works by Picasso on display during our visit in April 2022.)\\nWe also enjoyed the displays of musical instruments, Asian art, arms and armour and Egyptian art, though these were viewed in much less detail than I would have liked. The history contained in some of the artefacts is mind blowing - suits of armour worn by King Henry II of France and King Henry VIII of England, for example, and the antiquity within the section on Egyptian art and the Temple of Dendur, among others. Even Master Eight enjoyed our day at the Met, despite the lack of interactive displays and information aimed at children, and there were no complaints about being bored, so that was a definite plus!\\nI think I would live in New York City for the Met alone. Barring that, this would be at the top of places to revisit should we ever come back this way., Traveled with family World Class Museum, Four famous museums in the world: Louvre in Paris, France, the British Museum in London, UK, the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the Metropolitan Museum in New York City, United States.  \\n\\nThis museum perhaps is the only one in the American continent that will provide the closest visiting experience as that of the British Museum and Louvre in terms of quantity, variety, and representation.\\n\\nYou can\\'t see everything in one day. Forming a visit and route strategy before tackling this museum is highly recommended.  \\n\\nWhen I asked more than three staff at the visitor information kiosk about what are top three famous exhibits in this museum, unfortunately, none was able to provide.  Unlike Louvre has Mona Lisa, The Venus de Milo, Winged Victory of Samothrace, etc. and the Rosetta Stone, Lewis Chessmen, and Assyrian Lion Hunt Reliefs at the British Museum; there seems to lack of consensus on the Metropolitan Museum\\'s top three. \\n\\nThis is something you will decide, and personal preference.  For this reason, better picking themes that aligns with your interest. \\n\\nMy personal top two at the Metropolitan Museums:\\n* the Temple of Dendur\\n* the 19th and Early 20th Century European Paintings featuring Monet, Gauguin, Van Gogh, and Picasso. Multiple famous Monet paintings are housed here.\\n\\nIf you have time, spend at least two days to see them all.\\n\\nIf you are short on time, I would recommend focusing on seeing \"rare\" sections: ones harder to see and tour in North America in terms of scale, quantity, and variety, such as:\\n* Medieval Arts\\n* Ancient Near Eastern Art\\n* Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, and Later South Asia\\n* Asian Art: especially the Tibetan Art, Indian, and Southeast Asian Art inside the Asian Art section\\n\\nFoods from the food courts are freshly made with healthy options and variety, though as expected, price is a lot more expensive than food trucks right outside the main entrance.  The museum allows you to go in and out with your ticket, so may not be a bad idea to exit to grab lunch and come back in to save money.'"],"metadata":{"id":"LOvDsMGFWVdm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687724014339,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":176,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":44,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["async def query(payload):\n","  async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n","    res = await client.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)\n","    return res.json()"],"metadata":{"id":"H_rcAEwXUTw6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687724015453,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":156,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":45,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["payload = {\n","    \"inputs\": seq,\n","    \"parameters\": {\"candidate_labels\": [\"Outdoor Adventure\", \"Cultural/Historical Immersion\", \"Culinary Exploration\", \"Landmarks and Sightseeing\", \"Leisure and Indoor Recreation\"]},\n","}"],"metadata":{"id":"bGOv7Gu-UsUW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687724017357,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":159,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":46,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["payload = {\n","    \"inputs\": true_df['description'][28],\n","    \"parameters\": {\"candidate_labels\": [\"Outdoor Adventure\", \"Cultural/Historical Immersion\", \"Culinary Exploration\", \"Landmarks and Sightseeing\", \"Leisure and Indoor Recreation\"]},\n","}"],"metadata":{"id":"NjuOwHQHCmFn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687724173186,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":194,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":60,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["res = await query(payload)\n","res"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Ud8-Gy7YU0yN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687724175236,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":993,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}},"outputId":"1312a10e-5c02-48e1-836b-2b46298079ce"},"execution_count":61,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'sequence': 'Description: Visitors can retrace the steps of their ancestors at this famous landing point that welcomed millions of immigrants to the United States.',\n"," 'labels': ['Cultural/Historical Immersion',\n","  'Landmarks and Sightseeing',\n","  'Outdoor Adventure',\n","  'Leisure and Indoor Recreation',\n","  'Culinary Exploration'],\n"," 'scores': [0.8370577692985535,\n","  0.09233399480581284,\n","  0.028235971927642822,\n","  0.021458450704813004,\n","  0.020913828164339066]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":61}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["payload = {\n","    \"inputs\": true_df['REVIEWS'][28],\n","    \"parameters\": {\"candidate_labels\": [\"Outdoor Adventure\", \"Cultural/Historical Immersion\", \"Culinary Exploration\", \"Landmarks and Sightseeing\", \"Leisure and Indoor Recreation\"]},\n","}"],"metadata":{"id":"VVA3fB04D-ty","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687724193479,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":188,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":62,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["payload = {\n","    \"inputs\": \"\",\n","    \"parameters\": {\"candidate_labels\": [\"Outdoor Adventure\", \"Cultural/Historical Immersion\", \"Culinary Exploration\", \"Landmarks and Sightseeing\", \"Leisure and Indoor Recreation\"]},\n","}\n","async def query(seq):\n","  payload[\"inputs\"] = seq\n","  async with httpx.AsyncClient(verify = False) as client:\n","    res = await client.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)\n","    return res.json()"],"metadata":{"id":"tjnLmGbKNvxt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687725580794,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":151,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":97,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["res = await query(true_df['zinput'][38])\n","res"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"CL64847xFCmK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687725583592,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":180,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}},"outputId":"650355a4-14b6-4a98-cc3f-098638678d27"},"execution_count":99,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'sequence': \"categories: Cultural Events ; Description: You never forget the memories you make at the Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes.

We knew the Rockettes were dancers, but what we were going to see, we had no clue \\n\\nLet me tell you that it is truly a Christmas Spectacular.  Without ruining it, Santa makes a visit along with several scenes of singing and dancing. The show was between 90-120 minutes. It was an ABSOLUTE blast. I will be flying out in future years with more family specifically to see this show. \\n\\n2nd mezzanine was great to see the formations, but if $$ isn’t an issue I would aim for center-front on the lowest level., Traveled as a couple Ho, ho , hum!, The production and special effects are well done and most children will find it a delight. My senior colleagues said it felt more like synchronized swimming. It is worth getting off of your bucket list but I recommend seeing another show rather than going back for seconds., Traveled with friends Great show to take in while in NYC, What a fun show! Went to NYC with a friend and our daughters and when she mentioned she wanted to see this show I wasn't sure.  Did a little research and said, OK, we're in. So glad we did. It was a really good show and continuous from start to finish (no intermission) We did a Friday 10 am show and had no issues with security like some others have noted.  We went in the doors off 51st St. We were the first row in the 3rd Mezzanine - seats were good, but gave me a bit anxiety as the railing isn't all that tall (which is fine), but the floor slops slightly forward giving you a feeling of leaning you over the edge. Obviously this is only issue when standing.  The only other slight issue is at times there is a lot of things going on and a bit distracting - don't know where to look. But this didn't take away from the great show. I'd highly recommend.\",\n"," 'labels': ['Cultural/Historical Immersion',\n","  'Leisure and Indoor Recreation',\n","  'Landmarks and Sightseeing',\n","  'Outdoor Adventure',\n","  'Culinary Exploration'],\n"," 'scores': [0.4619423449039459,\n","  0.24743250012397766,\n","  0.12352319061756134,\n","  0.09220919758081436,\n","  0.07489284873008728]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":99}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["payload = {\n","    \"inputs\": \"\",\n","    \"parameters\": {\"candidate_labels\": [\"Outdoor Adventure\", \"Cultural/Historical Immersion\", \"Culinary Exploration\", \"Landmarks and Sightseeing\", \"Leisure and Indoor Recreation\"]},\n","}\n","async def query(seq):\n","  payload[\"inputs\"] = seq\n","  async with httpx.AsyncClient(verify = False) as client:\n","    res = await client.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)\n","    return res.json()"],"metadata":{"id":"HMVgkeI_TH74","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687726669888,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":178,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":122,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["payload = {\n","    \"inputs\": true_df['zinput'][28],\n","    \"parameters\": {\"candidate_labels\": [\"Outdoor Adventure\", \"Cultural/Historical Immersion\", \"Culinary Exploration\", \"Landmarks and Sightseeing\", \"Leisure and Indoor Recreation\"]},\n","}"],"metadata":{"id":"zA-X79JENVPD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687724357836,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":159,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":70,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["res = await query(payload)\n","res"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"vj9fG_DfNWM1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687724359287,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":147,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}},"outputId":"f6887444-ce47-4dd8-f22c-9a805726aca8"},"execution_count":71,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'sequence': 'categories: Historic Sites Points of Interest & Landmarks History Museums ; Description: Visitors can retrace the steps of their ancestors at this famous landing point that welcomed millions of immigrants to the United States. ; Reviews: Interesting and touching, We can here as part of trip to Liberty and Ellis Islands, from Battery Park in Manhattan but opted to return to Liberty State Park so we could explore New Jersey.\\nSelf-guided audio tour contained a lot of information and supported the exhibits on display in the rooms explaining process immigrants had to follow on arrival. For 10 dollars you’d the option to book a slot to check records and find entries for ancestors arriving here in the past. Don’t miss the full list of immigrant names printed in alphabetical order on long curved panels behind the building, accessed through the cafe.  \\n Your teens will love the “Through America’s Gate” exhibit, After taking the ferry to see the Statue of Liberty, we travelled across to Ellis Island. I thought we would be there max 30 minutes but the teens actually enjoyed it. In particular, they were captivated by the Through America’s Gate exhibit on the second floor. It showed via photos and artefacts the step by step process that immigrants were taken through to qualify for citizenship or be deemed an “undesirable alien” and face deportation. This included a medical examination, legal examination and potentially a hearing of special inquiry. The exhibit highlighted the living conditions, and the raw emotion of the immigrants in a very vulnerable time of their lives. The teens also enjoyed the Research Center where we found the immigration records for a great grandfather who landed on Ellis Island in 1914. Ellis Island captures the beautiful diversity of ethnicity and culture of immigrants entering NY whilst also acknowledging mistakes of the past. A must see., Traveled with family Great experience - get the first ferry, I visited Ellis Island in August 2021.  I bought my ferry ticket online the night before.  I took Exit 14C on the New Jersey Turnpike and arrived at the parking lot at about 7:20 am.  Parking costs $7.  The ferry building opens at 7:30 am and the security line for the first ferry opens at 8:30 am (the security is very strict and airport-like).  I took the 9 am ferry to Ellis Island.  There were only 20 people onboard and the trip takes about 10 minutes.  I then visited the Ellis Island Immigration Museum for 3 hours (a separate review).  I recommend starting out early as it is less crowded.  Later on in the day it was very crowded.  I also wish they did a better job of enforcing the mask requirement  during the ferry trip.  Anyway, it was a great experience.',\n"," 'labels': ['Cultural/Historical Immersion',\n","  'Landmarks and Sightseeing',\n","  'Outdoor Adventure',\n","  'Leisure and Indoor Recreation',\n","  'Culinary Exploration'],\n"," 'scores': [0.4082610607147217,\n","  0.34068965911865234,\n","  0.12204043567180634,\n","  0.0887143462896347,\n","  0.040294498205184937]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":71}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import requests\n","\n","API_URL = \"https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9\"\n","headers = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer 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\"}"],"metadata":{"id":"ZsvCF9yBYXpT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def query(payload):\n","\tresponse = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)\n","\treturn response.json()\n","\n","output = query({\n","    \"inputs\": true_df['zinput'][2100],\n","    \"parameters\": {\"candidate_labels\": [\"Outdoor Adventure\", \"Cultural/Historical Immersion\", \"Culinary Exploration\", \"Landmarks and Sightseeing\", \"Leisure and Indoor Recreation\"]},\n","})"],"metadata":{"id":"bOHT-McwXab5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687727222366,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":824,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":146,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["true_df['zoutput'] = true_df['zinput'].apply(lambda x: query({\n","    \"inputs\": x,\n","    \"parameters\": {\"candidate_labels\": [\"Outdoor Adventure\", \"Cultural/Historical Immersion\", \"Culinary Exploration\", \"Landmarks and Sightseeing\", \"Leisure and Indoor Recreation\"]},\n","}))"],"metadata":{"id":"dTEsvt89X9Kq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687728141293,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":720821,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":148,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["output = query({\n","    \"inputs\": \"Hi, I recently bought a device from your company but it is not working as advertised and I would like to get reimbursed!\",\n","    \"parameters\": {\"candidate_labels\": [\"refund\", \"legal\", \"faq\"]},\n","})\n"],"metadata":{"id":"JgVC9y-FXeC4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687727021734,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":175,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":128,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["activity_labels = [\"Outdoor Adventure\", \"Cultural/Historical Immersion\", \"Culinary Exploration\", \"Landmarks and Sightseeing\", \"Leisure and Indoor Recreation\"]"],"metadata":{"id":"X4xomK6FdIZD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687728460282,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":172,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}}},"execution_count":164,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from transformers import pipeline"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"R4OHImZDdM29","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687728579422,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":14239,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}},"outputId":"9d8fa109-2a7c-4fcc-8e06-5d4e34040dd1"},"execution_count":167,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/jax/_src/lax/eigh.py:35: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'process_rows' was never awaited\n","  import jax._src.numpy.linalg as jnp_linalg\n","RuntimeWarning: Enable tracemalloc to get the object allocation traceback\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["zero_shot_classifier = pipeline(\"zero-shot-classification\", model='valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-9')\n","\n","zero_shot_classifier(true_df['zinput'][0],  activity_labels) #

He knew all the history of the park and could relate some areas to popular scenes in movies like home alone which my children could relate to. If you don’t have time to walk the park or you just want an experience I would recommend you take a ride through the park. If you go to the entrance the horse and carriages are lined up. Go to the first one in the line. The cost was $140 US plus gratuities ($170) for 1 hour and it was well worth it and highly recommended., Traveled with family Woody Allen vibes !, I think all those who watch Bollywood movies would have a ton od dejavus when they come here. Trust me, this park is full of   nostalgia for movie lovers. This park has a Woody Allen kinda vibe !\\n\\nWe had a lovely time at this park. We took a guided tour in a bicycle cart and it was so fun. Our guide, 'Babu' was so good throughout the tour. He also gave us a $20 discount on the offer price. \\n\\nNevertheless, the park is absolute joy for all kinds of visitors, toddlers, the young and the old. So many people were taking a stroll, a run or just sitting by enjoying nature's bliss. \\n\\nI particularly like the fountain that's at the centre of the park. The water bridge is so cool and the sight of petite boats sailing under the bridge is such a pretty sight. \\n\\nYou'd almost always find couples getting their wedding photoshoot done here. The park is at a walking distance from a lot of other famous places in New York. \\n\\nWe were tourists, so we definitely loved this park, Traveled as a couple Perfect for All, Central Park is massive, and truly contains things for those of all ages and income levels. If you'd love to look at some beautiful scenery, enjoy the local wildlife, and visit statues, you can do so for free. If you have the money to spend, there's no shortage of family-friendly attractions within the park. Central Park is beautiful to spend time in no matter the season and no matter if you're a tourist or local.\",\n"," 'labels': ['Cultural/Historical Immersion',\n","  'Landmarks and Sightseeing',\n","  'Leisure and Indoor Recreation',\n","  'Outdoor Adventure',\n","  'Culinary Exploration'],\n"," 'scores': [0.36190465092658997,\n","  0.3542689085006714,\n","  0.10547860711812973,\n","  0.09496094286441803,\n","  0.0833868682384491]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":168}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["final_df = true_df.drop(columns = ['zinput', 'zoutput', 'des_reviews'])\n","final_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":803},"id":"8W6XI88s2MPa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687735611582,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":194,"user":{"displayName":"Karthik Raj","userId":"11829510175614690925"}},"outputId":"2de68fa6-d60e-4783-92a1-50bc9ac368c5"},"execution_count":184,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                PICTURE    DESTINATION  \\\n","0     https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/medi...
